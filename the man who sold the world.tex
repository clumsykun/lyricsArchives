            \item We passed upon the stair;
            \item We spoke of was and when.
            \item Although I wasn't there;
            \item He said I was his friend.
            \item Which came as a surprise;
            \item I spoke into his eyes:
            \item "I thought you died alone;
            \item A long long time ago"

            \item[*] Oh no, not me;
            \item[*] We never lost control.
            \item[*] You're face to face;
            \item[*] With the man who sold the world.

            \item[] \verse{2}
            \item I laughed and shook his hand;
            \item And made my way back home.
            \item I searched for form and land;
            \item For years and years I roamed.
            \item I gazed a gazeless stare;
            \item We marked a million hills.
            \item I must have died alone;
            \item A long, long time ago.
            
            \item[]

            \item[] \chorus*2
            \item[*] Who knows? Not me;
            \item[*] I never lost control.
            \item[*] You're face to face;
            \item[*] With the man who sold the world.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
            \item And she's buying a stairway to heaven
            \item When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
            \item With a word she can get what she came for

            \item[]
            \item[*] Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
            \item[]

            \item There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
            \item 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
            \item In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
            \item Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

            \item[]
            \item[*] Ooh, it makes me wonder
            \item[*] Ooh, it makes me wonder
            \item[] 

            \item There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
            \item And my spirit is crying for leaving
            \item In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
            \item And the voices of those who stand looking

            \item[]
            \item[*] Ooh, it makes me wonder
            \item[*] Ooh, it really makes me wonder
            \item[] 

            \item And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
            \item Then the piper will lead us to reason
            \item And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
            \item And the forests will echo with laughter

            \item[]

            \item If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
            \item It's just a spring clean for the May queen
            \item Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
            \item There's still time to change the road you're on

            \item[]
            \item[*] And it makes me wonder
            \pagebreak

            \item Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
            \item The piper's calling you to join him
            \item Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
            \item Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

            \item[]

            \item And as we wind on down the road
            \item Our shadows taller than our soul
            \item There walks a lady we all know
            \item Who shines white light and wants to show
            \item How everything still turns to gold
            \item And if you listen very hard
            \item The tune will come to you at last
            \item When all are one and one is all
            \item To be a rock and not to roll

            \item[]

            \item And she's buying a stairway to heaven

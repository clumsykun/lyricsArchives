            \item Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
            \item With stars to fill my dream
            \item I am a traveler of both time and space
            \item To be where I have been
            \item Sit with elders of the gentle race
            \item This world has seldom seen
            \item Talk of days for which they sit and wait
            \item And all will be revealed

            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{2}
            \item Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
            \item Sounds caress my ear
            \item But not a word I heard could I relate
            \item The story was quite clear

            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{3}
            \item Ooh, baby, I've been flying
            \item No, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
            \item Ooh, yeah, I've been flying
            \item Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'

            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{4}
            \item All I see turns to brown
            \item As the sun burns the ground
            \item And my eyes fill with sand
            \item As I scan this wasted land
            \item Trying to find, trying to find where I've been

            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{5}
            \item Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
            \item Like thoughts inside a dream
            \item Heed the path that led me to that place
            \item Yellow desert stream
            \item My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
            \item I will return again
            \item Sure as the dust that floats high in June
            \item When movin' through Kashmir

            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{6}
            \item Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
            \item Across the sea of years
            \item With no provision but an open face
            \item Along the straits of fear

            \item[]
            \item[] \outro
            \item[*] When I'm on, when I'm on my way
            \item[*] When I see, when I see the way, you stay
            \item[*] When I'm down
            \item[*] When I'm down, so down
            \item[*] Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
            \item[*] Come on, come on
            \item[*] Let me take you there, let me take you there

        \begin{enumerate}

            \item[] \ver{1}
            \item On a dark desert highway
            \item Cool wind in my hair
            \item Warm smell of colitas
            \item Rising up through the air
            \item Up ahead in the distance
            \item I saw a shimmering light
            \item My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
            \item I had to stop for the night
            \item There she stood in the doorway
            \item I heard the mission bell
            \item And I was thinking to myself
            \item "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
            \item Then she lit up a candle
            \item And she showed me the way
            \item There were voices down the corridor
            \item I thought I heard them say
        
            \item[]
            \item[] \chorus
            \item[*] "Welcome to the Hotel California
            \item[*] Such a lovely place
            \item[*] Such a lovely face
            \item[*] Plenty of room at the Hotel California
            \item[*] Any time of year
            \item[*] You can find it here"

            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{2}
            \item Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
            \item She got the Mercedes Bends, uh
            \item She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
            \item That she calls friends
            \item How they dance in the courtyard
            \item Sweet summer sweat
            \item Some dance to remember
            \item Some dance to forget
            \item So I called up the Captain
            \item "Please bring me my wine"
            \item He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
            \item And still those voices are calling from far away
            \item Wake you up in the middle of the night
            \item Just to hear them say
 
            \item[]
            \item[] \chorus
            \item[*] "Welcome to the Hotel California
            \item[*] Such a lovely place
            \item[*] Such a lovely face
            \item[*] They living it up at the Hotel California
            \item[*] What a nice surprise
            \item[*] Bring your alibis"
        
            \item[]
            \item[] \ver{3}
            \item Mirrors on the ceiling
            \item The pink champagne on ice
            \item And she said: "We are all just prisoners here
            \item Of our own device"
            \item And in the master's chambers
            \item They gathered for the feast
            \item They stab it with their steely knives
            \item But they just can't kill the beast
            \item Last thing I remember, I was
            \item Running for the door
            \item I had to find the passage back
            \item To the place I was before
            \item "Relax," said the night man
            \item "We are programmed to receive
            \item You can check out any time you like
            \item But you can never leave!"

        \item Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
        \item Is there anybody in there?
        \item Just nod if you can hear me
        \item Is there anyone home?
        \item Come on (Come on, come on), now
        \item I hear you're feeling down
        \item Well, I can ease your pain
        \item And get you on your feet again
        \item Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
        \item I'll need some information first
        \item Just the basic facts
        \item Can you show me where it hurts?

        \item[]
        \item[] \chorus
        \item There is no pain, you are receding
        \item A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
        \item You are only coming through in waves
        \item Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
        \item When I was a child, I had a fever
        \item My hands felt just like two balloons
        \item Now I've got that feeling once again
        \item I can't explain, you would not understand
        \item This is not how I am

        \item[]

        \item I have become comfortably numb

        \item Just a little pinprick
        \item There will be no more
        \item But you may feel a little sick
        \item Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
        \item I do believe it's working, good
        \item That'll keep you going through the show
        \item Come on, it's time to go

        \item Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
        \item When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
        \item Out of the corner of my eye
        \item I turned to look, but it was gone
        \item I cannot put my finger on it now
        \item The child is grown, the dream is gone
